# nvim

This is my personal Lua configuration for Neovim. Always a work in progress! designed for debian installation.

needs the following installed to run all the setup.

```
sudo apt-get install neovim
sudo apt-get install lazygit
```

Adding a nerd font to your Terminal will also be required, by default I'm using [FiraCode NF](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

typical install location for this repo is ~/.config/nvim

open this repository and navigate to logan/plugins.lua

saving the file with <space>w will install the requisite plugins within neovim
lsps are installed using Mason

Enjoy!
